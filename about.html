                <p class="bodypara">
                    The Marketing User-Interface team is comprised of Chris Engel and myself, Brandon Fulmer.  Chris and I created the website and the layout, as well as all the styling and visuals that you (the User) can see. We worked primarily in CSS and HTML and we published the website through Netlify.

                <p class="bodypara">
                    The react front-end team includes AJ Merritt, as well as Zac Higgins. These guys put together the 'log in' portion of the website as well as added functionality to various different areas. They use Flask in coordination with the back-end developers to make the magic happen.

                <p class="bodypara">
                    The back-end was done by Russ Terry and Mack Weber, they worked closely with the React team to manage the data that was coming in and then relayed it in a useable format to the Data Science team for processing.

                <p class="bodypara">
                    The Data Science team consisted of Stefano Ruiz as well as David Nagy. These two were responsible for analysing all of the information and then creating a way to match the information provided with the most relevant current subreddits.

                    The Machine Learning team created a model to house the data recieved from your (the User) inputs. The model takes a submitted post, converts it to numbers, then compares it to all the Reddit posts stored in its database.
